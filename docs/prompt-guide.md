# Documentation Maintenance Guide

## Core Principles

1. **Accuracy First**
   - Always verify against actual codebase
   - Never document hypothetical features
   - Update documentation when code changes
   - Remove outdated information immediately

2. **Consistency Check Order**
   1. Check actual implementation in code
   2. Verify types and interfaces
   3. Test functionality if possible
   4. Update related documentation files

3. **Documentation Structure**
   - Each doc file should have a clear purpose
   - Use consistent headers and sections
   - Include examples from actual code
   - Link related documentation

## File-Specific Rules

## Error Prevention

### 1. Before Updates
- Check current implementation
- Verify dependencies
- Test code examples
- Check related docs

## Version Control

### 1. Commit Messages
```
docs(scope): action description

- Detail 1
- Detail 2

Related: #issue
```

### 2. Change Tracking
- Note major changes
- Track breaking changes
- Update change logs
- Mark deprecated features 

## Human-Centric Approaches

### 1. Incremental Development
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- Focus on one component/feature at a time
- Test each piece before moving to the next
- Document progress and roadblocks as you go

### 2. Research and Learning
- Start with what you know
- Document what you don't know
- Research one topic at a time
- Keep notes of useful resources and solutions
- Document learnings for future reference

### 3. Revision Over Duplication
- Always search for existing documentation first
- Update existing files instead of creating new ones
- Keep a change history within the documentation
- Mark outdated sections for review
- Remove duplicate information

### 4. Note-Taking Practices
```markdown
### Working Notes Template
Current Task: [Task Name]
Status: [In Progress/Blocked/Done]

- [ ] Step 2 in progress
- [ ] Step 3 blocked by [reason]
```

### 5. Progressive Documentation
- Start with rough notes

- Update based on implementation experience
- Include practical examples from actual use
- Document gotchas and lessons learned

### 6. Context Preservation
- Keep track of why decisions were made
- Document alternative approaches considered
- Note environmental factors affecting choices
- Record assumptions and prerequisites
- Update when assumptions change

### 7. Error Recovery
- Document mistakes and their solutions
- Keep track of failed approaches
- Note debugging steps that worked
- Create troubleshooting guides from experience

- Why it needs to change
- Expected benefits

Alternatives Considered:
1. Option 1
   - Pros:
   - Cons:
2. Option 2
   - Pros:
   - Cons:
```

### 2. Prioritization Framework
- Is this blocking other work?
- Does it affect multiple components?
- Is it a security concern?
- Is it a performance issue?
- Is it a user-facing issue?

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Status Updates
```markdown
### Quick Status

ðŸŸ¡ Minor Issues
ðŸ”´ Blocked

Current Focus:
- What I'm working on now
- What's coming next
- What's blocking me

Need Help With:
- Specific questions
- Required reviews
- Technical blockers
```

### 2. Handoff Notes
```markdown
### Work Handoff
Last Action Taken:
- What was done
- Where to find it
- Current status

Next Steps:
- What needs to be done
- Important considerations
- Potential issues

Context Links:
- Related PRs
- Documentation
- Discussions
```

5. Update documentation with findings

### 3. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Documentation matches implementation
- [ ] All changes are documented
- [ ] Examples are updated
- [ ] Breaking changes are noted
- [ ] Dependencies are documented

## Time Management

### 1. Task Prioritization
```markdown
### Priority Matrix
Urgent & Important:
- Critical bugs
- Blocking issues

Important, Not Urgent:
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements

Urgent, Not Important:
- Minor fixes
- Small updates

Neither Urgent Nor Important:
- Nice-to-have features
- Non-critical updates
```

### 2. Time Allocation
- 15% Research and planning
- 40% Implementation
- 20% Testing and validation
- 25% Documentation and review
